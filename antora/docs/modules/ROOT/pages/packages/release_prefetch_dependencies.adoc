= Prefetch Dependencies Task Package

This package verifies that the prefetch-dependencies task is invoked with appropriate parameters to ensure secure dependency fetching.

== Package Name

* `prefetch_dependencies`

== Rules Included

[#prefetch_dependencies__mode_not_permissive]
=== link:#prefetch_dependencies__mode_not_permissive[Prefetch dependencies mode parameter check]

Verify the prefetch-dependencies task in the PipelineRun attestation was not invoked with the "permissive" mode parameter, which could compromise security.

*Solution*: Change the mode parameter of the prefetch-dependencies task from 'permissive' to a more secure value. The permissive mode may allow insecure dependency fetching practices.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Task 'prefetch-dependencies' was invoked with mode parameter set to 'permissive'`
* Code: `prefetch_dependencies.mode_not_permissive`
